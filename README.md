Trying to learn Go with 2023 Advent Of Code




# run test on single day
`make check day=1 part=1`

# run all tests
`make check-all`




# Notes
## Day 5 part 2
My part 2 solution is unfortunately still brute force, times are on my gaming rig (7950X3D, 64GB RAM, 4090). Need to figure out some algorithm/optimizations to solve this properly.
* Same method as in part 1, took 270 seconds
* When changed to concurrent, took 70 seconds
